## What is Fancy ? ##

Fancy is a dynamic, concurrent, pure object-oriented general purpose
programming language inspired by
[Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk),
[Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language), and
[Erlang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_programming_language).
It runs on [Rubinius](http://www.rubini.us).

The goal is to create a language implementation that is easy to
understand and improve, even for people new to language
implementation.

Fancy's compiler is currently written in Ruby, while all of Fancy's
standard library is written in Fancy itself. It's a good starting
point if you want to get a better feel for the language and its
built-in classes and methods, once you've mastered the fundamental
semantics and syntax.

Which leads us to:

## Basic concepts ##

Fancy is heavily inspired by [Smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), a pure object-oriented,
message passing dynamic programming language, developed at [XEROX PARC](http://www.parc.com/).
